* Connections from cortex to striatum
  * Cortex represents available choices, strength of cortical connections on striatal cells represents value of choices
  * Dopamine encodes Reward Prediction Error (RPE)
  * Change in dopamine concentration drives synaptic plasticity on frontal striatal synapses
* Learning on different timescales
  * Plasticity in amygdala operates on fast timescales; activity dependent
    * Susceptible to noise because of fast changes
  * Plasticity in striatum operates on slower timescales; dopamine dependent
