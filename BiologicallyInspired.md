Overview of models proposing biological backprop solutions  
* Locality of error signal, weight transport, unrealistic models of neurons
* Learning rules in biologically plausible models can be implemented with different types of spike-time-dependent plasticity
* Dynamics and plasticity of the models can be described within a common framework of energy minimization

* Replace transpose of weight matrix, *W<sup>T</sup>* with random weights *B*

Review of BPTT; general overview of attention and memory mechanisms used for Temporal credit assignment (TCA)
* Progress in solving difficult TCA has been made by memory- and attention-based architectures and algorithms
* Strengthens BPTTâ€™s position as a guide for thinking about TCA in artificial and biological systems

* Connections from cortex to striatum
  * Cortex represents available choices, strength of cortical connections on striatal cells represents value of choices
  * Dopamine encodes Reward Prediction Error (RPE)
  * Change in dopamine concentration drives synaptic plasticity on frontal striatal synapses
* Learning on different timescales
  * Plasticity in amygdala operates on fast timescales; activity dependent
    * Susceptible to noise because of fast changes
  * Plasticity in striatum operates on slower timescales; dopamine dependent
